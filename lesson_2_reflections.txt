What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I'm guessing that the nuts and bolts of a repository is set up. That is all environment variables are set up

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's a intermediary space - a preparation area. It's like preparing all the ingredients for a recipe before cooking.
