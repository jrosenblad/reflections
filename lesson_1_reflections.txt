How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped to pinpoint the lines of code that had been changed between versions, so that I only
needed to examine those lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would be easier to reuse code. More subtle errors would be easier to find. It would make it easier to try out different scenarios and return to the starting point

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The main con is propably forgetting to commit. The main pro is that you get to control what seems a logical commit size - that is, you don't waste space saving unnecesary changes (which will make it harder to retrace and debug)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Propably because the audience for the systems are different: Not many Google Docs users are likely to require multiple file tracking

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows a list of all the commits including the (hopefully) descriptive message included by the author. git diff can then be used to compare two commits, showing which lines have been changed

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
By knowing that you can allways revert to a previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
